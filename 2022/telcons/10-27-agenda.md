## Agenda
* This meeting immediately follows a [PATCG meeting](https://github.com/patcg/meetings/tree/main/2022/10/25-telecon) which is already a three hour marathon.  To give those attending that meeting a break, we will start no earlier than 10 minutes after the hour.
* [Consider building on top of Permissions instead of using the "storage access map"](https://github.com/privacycg/storage-access/issues/121)
* [Global Privacy Control](https://github.com/privacycg/proposals/issues/10)
* Any other business
